              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">In agrarian society male-female are like Beljodi of Hal (Bullock pair of a plough). In such situation both should be well versed with all the technological complexities and options for family livelihood. In the operational area of RBKS the status of women in society was pathetic. Impact of long socialization processes and lacks of control over financial sources the status of women in society continued to move down. </p>

              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">We believe that the purpose of education is to make the child a self-motivated and independent learner with the ability to think critically. SGJSS strives to develop educational opportunities for all children based on this idea. SGJSS conducts the IEC activities for awaking people about importance of education through following activities: 1. Community Mobilization and Awareness Activities for promotion of Education
                    2. School Bag & Dresses Distribution to BPL Children</p>

              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">Farming has always been one of the most important economic activities in India. With about two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture and agriculture-related activities, it is important to understand the plight of farmers in India and why they are  struggling to survive. According to a statement by the Maharashtra state government in 2018, 639 Indian farmers committed suicide within three months due to drought and crippling debts. Farmers need to be educated about the schemes and grants provided by the government. </p>

              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">Majority of India’s population still lives in the villages. The numbers of youths are also increasing in the villages. The number of youth is increasing faster than the rate of job creation. Youths are considered as the future of any nation.The youth comprises over one-third of the Indian population which in turn constitutes a major part of the labor force of the country. The number of underprivileged youth in India who lack education and proper guidance is humungous.
                    It is not their lack of knowledge that is the reason for this. It is because they do not possess the right skills and attitude. It is crucial for the energy of the underprivileged youth to be channelized properly with proper direction and learning to aid in their economic growth and make them contribute to nation-building.</p>

              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">We work for old age society as we know that majority of 71% of the elderly population lives in rural India and 29% in the urban. Factors like literacy level, economic independence, age-old dependency ratio, diseases and other health impacts vary.

                    Due to economic dependency, elderly women suffer the most. All elderly persons are vulnerable to disabilities, dementia and other physical and mental ailments. Around 6.4% of elderly in rural areas and 5.5% in urban areas suffer from at least one or more of these, the later being more susceptible to stress-related disorders like heart diseases and blood pressure.
                    
                    With rapid urbanisation and a shift in socio-economic priorities, traditional family structures and values have changed. The trend of small, nuclear families is more prevalent than joint families. To make matters worse, the rising rate of old-age illnesses and lack of affordable geriatric services adds pressure on families. Illiteracy, poor financial savings/opportunities and fast-paced life leave the elderly neglected and cared for. Meager old age pensions provided by the government (Rs. 200 per month in many states barring few like Goa where it is Rs. 2000) are insufficient. It is a matter of concern that India spends only 0.032% in pensions, covering just 25% percent of the elderly population, compared to Nepal which covers 47% and China 74%.</p>

                  <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">Due to lack of hygienic awareness, poor sanitation, bad drinking water quality, gender issues, superstitions, early marriage and pregnancy, frequent pregnancy, lack of balance diet, delay in treatment, infection and lack of cleanliness several health related problems exist in the working area including higher mortality (during delivery and pregnancy). In absence of proper infrastructure and transport facilities, the geographical conditions render rural area inaccessible to government health services. Hence to improve health conditions of the rural area we focus on preventive measures like, awareness generation of community on all aspects of health, vaccination, nutritional food intakes etc through awareness camps and free health checkup camps.We adopted curative measures like health camps, awareness programmes etc. SGJSS promoted community meetings, foot marches (Pad Yatra), health check up awareness camps. Micro planning was done to know seasonality and frequency of diseases and paying capabilities of the population. During this period mainly work for women reproductive health and child health was done. It makes a different image in the area. Social mapping was done to locate; reach to health worker, pregnant women, Dai’s home, distance of hospital for delivery, road vehicles etc. were located. Micro planning also done to know seasonality and frequency of disease, how many people have capacity to bear cost of treatment, and how many believes in superstitions.</p>

              <hr>
                  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:17px;">The forests of India are ancient in nature and composition. SGJSS is providing wildlife education to the community. Because, they are rich in variety and shelter a wide range of flora and fauna and insects. The fact they have existed from time immemorial is substantiated from the ancient texts all of which have some mention of the forests. The people venerated forests and a large number of religious ceremonies centered on trees  and plants.

                    Even today in parts of India the sacred forests exist and are worshiped. The wildlife in India is equally diverse and rich. From big animals like elephants and tiger and deer and bisons to small reptiles the Indian forests are teeming with life force. But unfortunately most Indians don’t understand the importance of this rich wealth of forest and wildlife India has. Felling of tress and illegal poaching of animals are fast depleting the forest and wild life wealth of India. So efforts must be taken to stop these malpractices and conserve the forest and wild life of India.
                    
                    The conservation of forest & wildlife is required for the following benefits:
                     The wildlife helps us in maintaining the ‘balance of nature’. Once this equilibrium is disturbed it leads to many problems. The destruction of carnivores or insectivores often leads to the increase of herbivores which in turn affects the forest vegetation or
                    The wildlife can be used commercially to earn more and more money. It can increase our earning of foreign exchange, by
                    The preservation of wildlife helps many naturalists and behavior biologists to study morphology, anatomy, physiology, ecology, behavior biology of the wild animals under their natural
